# STM32 Microcontroller Calculator

This project is coded in C++ and Assembly Language. The objective was to implement a simple calculator using C++ and assembly language. 

The operations including multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction are coded in assembly language. Each operation is contained in a separate file. The main file (main.cpp) contains a function to read input from a keypad, perform respective operations on the input, and output the result on a PuTTY serial output terminal.
